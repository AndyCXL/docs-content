<FeatureDescription>

The Arduino® Nicla Sense Env provides real-time environmental monitoring in a compact design. It integrates the ultra low-power **HS4001** temperature and humidity sensor, the **ZMOD4410** indoor air quality sensor for detecting volatile organic compounds (TVOC) and estimating CO₂ levels, and the **ZMOD4510** outdoor air quality sensor for monitoring nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and ozone (O₃).

Powered by the **Renesas RA2E1 microcontroller**, it delivers low-power performance, enabling **sensor networks** and scalable projects for environmental monitoring, automation, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The board is compatible with **Portenta, MKR, Nano and other Arduino-compatible boards**, making it ideal for **high-performance projects requiring sensor fusion**. Its onboard **ESLOV connector** allows for easy expansion and communication with other devices.

Designed for long-lasting, autonomous applications, it can be battery-powered for standalone operation, offering an excellent solution for environmental sensing with ultra-low power consumption.
