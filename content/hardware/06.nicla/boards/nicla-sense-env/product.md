The Arduino® Nicla Sense Env offers advanced environmental sensing in a compact form. It integrates a temperature and humidity sensor (**HS4001**), an indoor air quality sensor (**ZMOD4410**) and an outdoor air quality sensor (**ZMOD4510**). Powered by the **Renesas® RA2E1 microcontroller** and featuring an ESLOV connector, the Nicla Sense Env enables ultra low-power sensor networks for environmental applications. The board is compatible with Portenta, MKR, Nano and other Arduino boards, making it ideal for scalable, high-performance projects requiring sensor fusion. Please note that the Nicla Sense Env requires a Portenta, MKR, Nano, or other Arduino-comaptible board to operate, it is not a standalone product.
